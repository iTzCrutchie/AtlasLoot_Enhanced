# AtlasLoot_Enhanced
AtlasLoot Enhanced Updated for The War Within. I do not take credit for the original AtlasLoot Enhanced. That goes to the original authors, Lag123 and others listed on the main [Curseforge website](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlasloot-enhanced).

I have simply took fixes from the community and [repsejnworb](https://github.com/repsejnworb/AtlasLootTWWFix/releases/tag/atlaslootenhanced-tww-fix-11.0). From there I started adding the items. 

## Status
There are still several items that are missing and I will be updating loot and items as I can. This version has all factions, mounts, Nerub-ar, and the upcoming World Events, Brewfest and Hallow's End.


### Disclaimer
I am uploading this to Github for the time being for the community to use an updated AtlasLoot Enhanced. I know there is the Dungeon Journal but AtlasLoot provides more tables than just the dungeons and raids. I am working on this in my free time so some updates may be really fast others may e slow. If you want to contribute, please use issues or pull requests.
