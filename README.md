# AtlasLoot_Enhanced
AtlasLoot Enhanced Updated for The War Within. I do not take credit for the original AtlasLoot Folder. That goes to the original authors, Lag123 and others listed on the main Curseforge website: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlasloot-enhanced

I have simply took fixes from the community (https://github.com/repsejnworb/AtlasLootTWWFix/releases/tag/atlaslootenhanced-tww-fix-11.0). From there I started adding the items. There are still several that are missing and I will be updating loot and items as I can. This version currently has all the factions and mounts moved over and will have the raid and dungeons within the week.

I am uploading to Github for others to pull from and contribute if they are up for it. If the authors ask me to take this down I will but just wanted to provide an update to the ommunity for the time being.
